Robot Garden RoboGames Planner
==============================
:toc: macro

= Possible Participants
* PRSG group
* Home Brew Robotics
* SVRos

= Potential Sponsors
* Potential
* City of Livermore
* Switch/i-Gate
* RoboHub
* Schools?
* Tech companies?

= Venue
* Tricky

= Events, Competitions and prizes
* Table Top
* Indoor Magellan
* Line Follow
* Performance
** e.g. our square dancing
** Each team has x minutes to perform
* Utility
** e.g. drawbot
** Each team describes their project
** Each team has x minutes to demonstrate
* Teach the basic skills needed to get started. A goal with a timeline is valuable and could flow nicely into RoboGames

= Maker Aspect as well?
I think the idea here is to provide space for individuals to show off their projects or we could make it a stage demonstration/performance.
