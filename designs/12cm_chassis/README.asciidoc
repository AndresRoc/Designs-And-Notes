= 12cm Chassis Design

:imagesdir: .

This design is a narrow robot, only 12cm in diameter, designed to be able to compete in Micro-mouse competitions with an 18cm square maze cell and 50mm high walls.

== Parts

Because of the small size, the robot is designed to use micro-metal gear motors rather than the larger 25mm gear motors.

I also populated the Arduino pins and the RPi GPIO extension on the A-Star with link:https://www.pololu.com/category/134/0.1-2.54-mm-male-headers[male headers]. I used multiple colors to categorize the pins, but that's not necessary, of course. (I prefer male headers on the A-Star because female pins on ribbon cable seem to seat more soundly. The downside is that you can accidentally drop something conductive on the exposed male pins, of course.)
